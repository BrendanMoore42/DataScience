# Portfolio Overview

I publish all my work everyday, completed or not. You can find all notebook and script work in my [Data Science Github Repo](https://github.com/kavisek/DataScience). If you are new to DataScience I would suggest taking a look a the "Tutorial" folder. This folder contains all my course notebook and dictated notebooks, created when I was researching useful Python Packages.

## Study Material

<br>I study via using dictations, therefore I have catologue all my dictactions in the [Tutorials Folder](https://github.com/kavisek/DataScience/tree/master/Tutorials) within the repo. Each dictation includes the original source of the material for referencing.
