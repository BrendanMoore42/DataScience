### Directory Information

This sub directory is a catalog of tutorials, walkthrough, and reference material of python package and topics. When studying, I use dictation as one of my main learning tools, all the code in this directory has been dictated by hand and slightly modified for use with python 3. 


The direct source for each notebook are provided in the notebook file. Please reference the source link for a complete explanation.
