    "Oftentimes we have text data that we want to classify. While it is possible to use a type of convolutional network, we are going to focus on a more popular option: the recurrent neural network. The key feature of recurrent neural networks is that information loops back in the network. This gives recurrent neural networks a type of memory it can use to better understand sequential data. A popular choice type of recurrent neural network is the long short-term memory (LSTM) network which allows for information to loop backwards in the network.\n",
